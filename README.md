# nodejs-graphql-course
This is part of my NodeJs course: https://github.com/Yevhwnii/nodejs-shop-course

Particullary, this application was developed in order to play around with GraphQL world. 

Core application was previous part of my course (https://github.com/Yevhwnii/nodejs-restapi-course) and I tried to turn it into GraphQL API

Skills acquired:
1. Understanding what GraphQL is, why I might use it, what benefits this API has over REST API
2. Learned how to create schemas and resolvers. How to then properly interact with database and perform server side logic.
3. Learned how to write queries on the frontend so I can grab data from GraphQL API which I only need
4. Learned how to implement authentication and authorizaiton using this type of API
5. Converted my REST API application to GraphQL
